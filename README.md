# zbxtoolkit
Python function library for interfacing with the Zabbix API.
Makes performing changes to a large scale Zabbix setup a whole lot easier.
Well, that is the aim at least.

Under the hood it uses the [PyZabbix][1] library to talk to Zabbix.

Do note these functions are still a work in progress.
